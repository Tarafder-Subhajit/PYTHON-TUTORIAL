=====================================================================================Strings===========================================================================================
1. String Data Type in Python:

In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, enclosed within single (' '), double (" "), or triple (''' ''' or """ """) quotes.
Strings are immutable, meaning you cannot change the characters within a string directly. Instead, you create new strings.
You can access individual characters in a string using indexing, e.g., my_string[0] will give you the first character.
Strings support various built-in methods, such as len(), upper(), lower(), strip(), replace(), and more, for manipulation.
2. String Manipulation and Formatting:

Concatenation: You can combine strings using the + operator.
Substrings: Use slicing to extract portions of a string, e.g., my_string[2:5] will extract characters from the 2nd to the 4th position.
String interpolation: Python supports various ways to format strings, including f-strings (f"...{variable}..."), %-formatting ("%s %d" % ("string", 42)), and str.format().
Escape sequences: Special characters like newline (\n), tab (\t), and others are represented using escape sequences.
String methods: Python provides many built-in methods for string manipulation, such as split(), join(), and startswith().


================================================================================Numberic Data Type===================================================================================
1. Numeric Data Types in Python (int, float):

Python supports two primary numeric data types: int for integers and float for floating-point numbers.
Integers are whole numbers, and floats can represent both whole and fractional numbers.
You can perform arithmetic operations on these types, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.
Be aware of potential issues with floating-point precision, which can lead to small inaccuracies in calculations.
Python also provides built-in functions for mathematical operations, such as abs(), round(), and math module for advanced functions.


================================================================================Regex=================================================================================================
1. Regular Expressions for Text Processing:

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text processing.
The re module in Python is used for working with regular expressions.
Common metacharacters: . (any character), * (zero or more), + (one or more), ? (zero or one), [] (character class), | (OR), ^ (start of a line), $ (end of a line), etc.
Examples of regex usage: matching emails, phone numbers, or extracting data from text.
re module functions include re.match(), re.search(), re.findall(), and re.sub() for pattern matching and replacement.
